#### Refactoring

- [ ] Refactor main classes involved in note formatting workflow to reduce cognitive load

- [ ] ...

#### Performance

- [ ] Switch to more performant LLM that still fits in 24GB VRAM GPU
- [ ] Review system prompt and few shot examples to match current format style
- [ ] Make sure we are using prefix caching in vLLM
- [ ] Create an agent: often, an agent can do a better job compared to a simple completion call. Notes are never introduced in isolation. It can be beneficial for an agent to review existing notes, and even suggest splitting a note into multiple notes, change note type, or more sophisticated operations

#### Testing
- [ ] Convert tests in `tests/integration/test_qdrant_integration.py::test_overlapping_sociable_behavior_with_real_dependencies` to proper **narrow** integration tests. It currently takes over 30 seconds to run
- [ ] Convert tests in `tests/integration/test_qdrant_integration.py::test_real_qdrant_performance_characteristics` to proper **narrow** integration tests. It currently takes over 3 seconds to run
- [ ] Ensure we have narrow integration tests, and leverage nullables for e2e tests
- [ ] Review e2e tests, and keep only one for each main scenario (main path)
